Federal Election Commission.</p><p>As public faith in democratic institutions has plummeted over the past few decades, Reich (Robert??)has predicted that America will likely move towards authoritarian populism or engage in fundamental democratic change in the long term.</p><p>The loss of trust in democratic institutions is a major reason that extremist movementsprimarily operate outside of mainstream politics.</p><h3 id="Economic-Crises">Economic Crises</h3><p>Beyond ideological divisions, America and countries around the world have suffered a prolonged period of low economic growth and high income inequality spurred by the 2008 global financial.</p><p>During the 2008 Great Recession, 9 millions jobs were lost and the salaries of remaining jobs were cut.</p><p>The stock market fell by 50%</p><p>Taxpayers were forced to pay over $100 billion dollars to bailout AIG.</p><p>The Glass-Steagall Act made it illegal for the same bank to both issue mortgages to homebuyers and toturn around to sell those mortgages as bonds to investors.</p><p>It required that a commercial bank (a bank that takes deposits from you and me and issues mortgages and commercial loans) be separated from an investment bank (a bank that issues bonds/derivatives/any other types of risky ventures).</p><p>When financial experts talk about “breaking up the big banks,” this is what they refer to.</p><p>Citizens United allowed political campaigns to accept unlimited monetary contributions fromcorporations, unions, and other groups.</p><p>It also spawned the creation of super PACS and triggered a boom in political influence by tax-exempt, right-wing, dark money organizations.</p><p>This paradox is the result of either regulatory capture (e.g., wealthy individuals or corporations influencing the government to reduce business competition to rig the market in their favor) or globalization and technological advancement (e.g., automation).</p><p>The combination of low growth and high inequality historically results in political instability and increases the likelihood of insurrection, rebellion, and reactionary political forces.</p><p>Low economic growth, a shrinking middle class, and authoritarian populism are factors associated with increased political polarization and the rise of extremism.</p><p>This rise also reflects populations that have experienced the lowest levels of economicgrowth in the 21st century. Market reforms have increasingly redistributed wealth away from the middle class. This may be one reason that members of extremist groups are predominantly from the middle rather than the working class.</p><p>As the economy has struggled, and as unemployment and underemployed have remained high, American nationalism has appealed to a larger demographic and, most saliently, to college-educated White men.</p><p>A generation of young Americans are graduating with enormous school debt.</p><p>In 2019, for instance, 42 million student borrowers collectively owed $1.5 trillion dollars.</p><p>The White Power Movement</p><p>From the late 1970s to early 1980s, Belew describes the Vietnam War as the maincultural framework uniting different factions of the White Power Movement.</p><p>Movement members often served in the military. Louis Beam, author of Essays of a Klansman, served in Vietnam. His essays describe a culture of stymied grief and betrayal by the American government among war veterans. Similar narratives played a role in structuring paramilitary activists in the WPM and generating new groups like the Alt-Right.</p><p>Unlike World War II, which centered around moral narratives against the rise of Nazism, Vietnam symbolized a morally ambiguous war.</p><p>Antiwar protests were widely held against the government’s imperialistic policies, intensified by public fears of rising globalism and communism.</p><p>Following the Vietnam War, the WPM experienced a profound shift at the 1983 AryanNations World Congress conference when movement leaders formally declared war on thefederal government.</p><p>At the conference, different factions and ideological camps affirmed their shared commitment to undermining the American government. Unlike earlier groups, such as the K.K.K., which adhered to and fought on behalf of the state, the WPM now rejected major premises of the conservative movement (e.g. moral traditionalism, economic liberty, strong national defense) and began to construct a new national identity within the movement.</p><h3 id="National-Identity">National Identity</h3><p>National identity is a socially constructed category based on subjective feelings oneshares with a group about one’s nation.</p><p>Americans generally share a strong national identity based on the idea that the nation is an egalitarian, moral, and democratic superpower.</p><p>Unlike patriotism, which is a benign attachment to one’s country, nationalism encompasses an orientation towards superiority and dominance over other nations.</p><p>American identity has further been portrayed as the successful assimilation to Anglo-Protestantvalues, and White identity has been positively correlated with American identity.</p><p>When nationalism focuses on ethnicity, studies reveal greater prejudice towardsimmigrant groups.</p><p>Since Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1990, anti-immigrant hate groups have been at their most extreme.</p><p>For over 150 years, the U.S.-Mexico border has been rooted in White power vigilante groups and BorderPatrol agents collaborating to detain immigrants.</p><p>From 1910 to 1920, hundreds of Mexicans were murdered and lynched at the Texas borders.</p><p>Following the Vietnam War, paramilitary training camps (e.g., Klan Border Watch) trained activists to capture migrants in South Texas.</p><p>In 2019, the WPM captured hundreds of immigrants along the border and publicized the event online.</p><p>The WPM has strongly advocated for anti-immigration policies.</p><p>During Charlottesville, K.K.K. leader David Duke expressed: “We are determined to take our country back. Fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s why we voted for Trump.”</p><p>The Trump administration has vowed to remove “millions of illegal aliens” using Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), portraying immigrants aseconomic and cultural threats.</p><p>Furthermore, rather than understanding the fluctuation of economic opportunities as the result of either regulatory capture, global or technological advancements, almost twice as many Americans believe that immigrants take away job opportunities rather than helping to improve the national economy.</p><p>Yet, evidence shows that immigrants stimulate the economy by creating new jobs, spending income on American goods and services, paying taxes, and raising the overall productivity of businesses.</p><p>Undocumented immigrants also pay an estimated $11.6 billion a year in taxes and take on jobs that boost the economy.</p><p>In addition to anti-immigrant sentiment, national identity can also be “constructed as amasculine space, which may exclude and devalue non-stereotypically masculine ideas and waysof being”.</p><p>Both men and women were found to consider male-associated traits more American than female traits. As men have greater access to political power, they likely experience greater ownership overnational material and symbolic resources…<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href="">Political Extremism in the Wake of Charlotesville: The Motivations and Ideologies of the White Power Movement</a><br><strong>Publication:</strong> <a href="">The Psychology of Inequity: Motivation and Beliefs</a><br><strong>Publisher:</strong> <a href="https://www.abc-clio.com/">ABC-CLIO, LLC.</a><br><strong>Date:</strong> Jan 2021<br><strong>Author(s):</strong> Tina R.

      <title>Dynamic Social Impact Theory</title>
      <link href="/blog/dynamic-social-impact-theory/"/>
      <url>/blog/dynamic-social-impact-theory/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Description">Description</h2><p>Dynamic social impact theory is a concept created by American social psychologist, Bibb Latané in 1981.</p><p>It describes as complex systems</p><h2 id="Basic-Tenets">Basic Tenets</h2><p>Dynamic social impact theory suggests that culture is created and shaped by local social influence as people influence and are influenced by others in proportion to their strength, immediacy, and number.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>The influence of members between majority and minority groups change and develop over time and four group-level phenomena emerge which can be defined as follows:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p><h3 id="Consolidation">Consolidation</h3><p>As individuals interact with each other regularly, their actions, attitudes, and opinions become more uniform. The opinions held by the majority tend to spread throughout the group, while the minority decreases in size.</p><h3 id="Clustering">Clustering</h3><p>Occurs when group members communicate more frequently as a consequence of close proximity. As the law of social impact suggests, individuals are susceptible to influence by their closest members, and so clusters of group members with similar opinions emerge in groups. Minority group members are often shielded from majority influence due to clustering. Therefore, subgroups can emerge which may possess similar ideas to one another, but hold different beliefs than the majority population.</p><h3 id="Correlation">Correlation</h3><p>Over time, individual group members’ opinions on a variety of issues (including issues that have never been openly discussed before) converge, so that their opinions become correlated.</p><h3 id="Continuing-diversity">Continuing diversity</h3><p>As mentioned previously, minority members are often shielded from majority influence due to clustering. Diversity exists if the minority group can resist majority influence and communicate with majority members. However, if the majority is large or minority members are physically isolated from one another, this diversity decreases.</p><h2 id="Social-Impact-Theory-SIT">Social Impact Theory (SIT)</h2><blockquote><p>According to SIT, social impact is the amount of social influence individuals have on one another and is amultiplicative function of strength (elements that make a person more persuasive or better able to resist persuasion, such as expertise, physical attractiveness, or personality), immediacy, and number. Immediacy isdefined as closeness in social space. Social space is constrained by physical space (Latané &amp; Liu, 1996; Nowak, Latané, &amp; Lewenstein, 1994), but not completely equivalent to it. For example, in an apartment building, a person may be more immediate to a downstairs neighbor (Bob), than one who lives beside him (Joe), if the person passes by Bob’s but not Joe’s apartment every day on his way out of the building. Influence declines exponentially as social space increases (Latané et al., 1995). Number is the number of people doing the influencing or being influenced, and is also a power function. Each additional person adds a little less unique influence. You will be more influenced by two people arguing a position than one person, but the 301st person probably will not have much influence beyond the 300th. SIT has been well supported by studies examining a variety of types of influence situations. High strength persuaders, operationalized in terms of status (Williams &amp; Williams, 1983), expertise (Wolf &amp; Latané, 1983), or dress (Jackson &amp; Latané, 1981a; Sedikides &amp; Jackson, 1990; Williams &amp; Williams, 1989) are more influential than lower strength persuaders. Immediacy also has an effect on influence. Zoo visitors comply more readily to requests made by an experimenter who is physically closer to them than to one in another room (Sedikides &amp; Jackson, 1990),and people in the USA and China report more influence from those who live closest to them.Number has received the most empirical attention, likely due to its easy manipulation. The number of people endorsing a particular restaurant choice (Wolf &amp; Latané), donating money to cancer research (Jackson &amp; Latané, 1981a), or choosing one answer over another (Asch, 1955) affect social influence. These factors also seem to combine multiplicatively as the theory suggests (e.g. Jackson &amp; Latané, 1981a, b; Latané &amp; Harkins, 1976; Wolf &amp; Latané).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:1">[1:1]</a></sup></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>SIT is a static theory, however, predicting influence on one element at a time and from one person or group to another. In reality, of course, influence is reciprocal (you influence me as I influence you) and recursive (we continue to influence one another on a variety of issues over time). Hence…&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:2">[1:2]</a></sup></p></blockquote><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00022.x">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00022.x</a> <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a> <a href="#fnref1:1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a> <a href="#fnref1:2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/gdn0000185">https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/gdn0000185</a> <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>]]></content>
