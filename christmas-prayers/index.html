But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.”</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to him his wife, and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son.

And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid. Then the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be the sign to you: You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger.”</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">“Glory to God in the highest,</span><br><span class="line">And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!”</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="The-Essential-Doctrine-of-Jesus’-Virgin-Birth">The Essential Doctrine of Jesus’ Virgin Birth</h2>
<h3 id="Jesus-is-Fully-God">Jesus is Fully God</h3>
<ul>
<li>We know that Jesus is Fully God. Not part God, not semi-devine, not a demigod, not a God created… He is fully God, which means He’s always been, He is, and He evermore will be.</li>
<li>He is the 2nd person of the trinity.  Through Him, John would say, “The world was created and nothing was created without Him.”</li>
<li>He was conceived by The Holy Spirit. Therefore He is fully God, and not part God.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Jesus-is-Fully-Human">Jesus is Fully Human</h3>
<ul>
<li>He comes from the seed of a woman. Through Mary, with an ancestry all the way back to Eve.</li>
<li>Because His earthly father did not have a part in the conception, Jesus is born without a Sin nature (which we inherit from Adam).  Instead the conception is done by The Holy Spirit, which makes Jesus both fully God and fully human, but without sin.</li>
<li>This is essential to qualifying Him for being our savior, to fulfill the requirements of who could pay the penalty for our sin.</li>
</ul>

<p>A kinsman redeemer is a relative who, at his own expense, pays off the debts of another.

<li>He is our relative who can provide for and protect us by laying down His own life and covering our sin.</li>
<li>Jesus is the fulfillment of the Kinsman Redeemer</li>
